# RV32I-core
This is currently a work-in progress, and shall continue to be so for the foreseeable future. I intend to expand the Instruction Memory of my pipelined-core and subsequently implement and evaluate basic branch-predictors.

If you are interested in completed implementations, check out the following:
- [Single-cycle-core:](single-cycle-working)  A minimal single-cycle RISCV core
- [Pipelined-core:](pipeline-working)  A minimal pipelined RISCV core with support for forwarding and stalling
